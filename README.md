# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java

This repository contains my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.

I created this repository to practice DSA concepts step by step and to improve my
problem-solving and logical thinking skills.

This is a learning-focused repository, not a showcase project.

## 📌 What is DSA?

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** are used to:
- Organize data in a structured way
- Solve problems efficiently
- Write optimized and readable code

Data Structures define **how data is stored**,  
Algorithms define **how problems are solved** using that data.

Strong DSA fundamentals are important for:
- Coding interviews
- Competitive programming
- Backend and software development

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized topic-wise for better clarity.

src
├── array
│ └── Question1.java
├── stack
│ └── Problem1.java
├── queue
│ └── QueueQuestion1.java


- Each **DSA topic has its own folder**
- Each **problem is written in a separate Java class**
- The structure is kept simple and easy to understand

## ☕ Why Java for DSA?

I chose **Java** for learning DSA because:

- Java has clear and readable syntax
- Strong object-oriented programming concepts
- Widely used in interviews and real-world projects
- Helps build a solid foundation for backend development

Java allows me to focus more on **logic and concepts** instead of low-level details.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice DSA consistently
- Improve logical and analytical thinking
- Track daily progress using GitHub commits
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews

---

## 🚀 Future Plan

- Add more DSA topics (Linked List, Tree, Graph, DP, etc.)
- Solve more problems with increasing difficulty
- Improve time and space complexity of solutions

---

## ✅ Note

This repository represents my **learning journey**.
The goal is progress and consistency, not perfection.
